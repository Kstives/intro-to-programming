'12' < '9';
// this expression evaluates to false because the string '12' does not equal the string '9'

/*
Launch School answer: " the expression evaluates as true since the operands are strings, not numbers. When you compare two strings, JavaScript performs a character-by-character comparison going from left to right, so on the first comparison, it determines that '1' < '9', so '12' must be less than '9'.'"
